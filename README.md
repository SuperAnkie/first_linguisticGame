This is a linguistic game which teaches the hero/heroine to learn Dothraki, so that he/she could solve a riddle to rescue somebody(definitely should be an important person, maybe your visa officer) in trap. 
The game is divided into three parts. 
The first part is an opening animation, which is incharged by Lingzhi Li. The second part is the menu, on which the gamer can choose to start the game, to check the achievement, and end the game. The third part is the game content, in which the gamer has to answer two questions concerning linguistic knowledge of Dothraki.

The package needed to run the game is stored in this repo. The script is written by Python ("final_script.py"), all music and images are available. In addition, a description/coding report is provided to explain the work ("discription.pdf").
